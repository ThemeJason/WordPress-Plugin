Use advanced theme.json features (which are basically where modern WordPress theme store styles) from the future, today with Theme Jason.

== Description ==

Theme Jason has partnered with some of the best designers in the world to provide you with unique style options for most popular WordPress themes. To make this as easy as possible we needed a few features that weren't in WordPress (yet) so we decided instead of making your wait until WordPress caught up with us we'd develop those features ourselves and put them in a plugin.

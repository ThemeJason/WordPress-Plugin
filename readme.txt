The secret sauce to using all the fun styles on themejason.com.

== Description ==

Theme Jason has partnered with some of the best designers in the world to provide you with unique style options for most popular WordPress themes. To make this as easy as possible we needed a few features that weren't in WordPress (yet) so we decided instead of making your wait until WordPress caught up with us we'd develop those features ourselves and put them in a plugin.

These features include:
* The ability to import/export global style settings
* The ability to add fonts from Google Fonts

This plugin requires you be running WordPress 5.6 Beta.
